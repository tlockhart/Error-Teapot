1. Target audience:
    - Artists.
2. Problem the product addresses:
    - Online media sharing websites have made content sharing quick and easy.  However, many sites do not ensure that artists get compensated for their work.  This app will seek to empower artists to post and charge a fee for the use of their work. 
3. Primary goal of the product:
    - Create a platform for artists to advertise and get paid for their work.
4. The essential features of the application:
    - As an artist, I want to login to my portfolio.
    - As an artist, I want to enter a brief bio.
    - As an artist, I want to manage the content in my porfolio.
    - As an artist, I want to set the asking price of my work.
    - As an artist, I want a buyer to be able to contact me.
    - As a viewer, I want to be able to view an artist's gallery.
    - As a buyer, I want to be able to contact an artist to purchase their work.
